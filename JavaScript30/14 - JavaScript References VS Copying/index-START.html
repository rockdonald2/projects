    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let x = 5;
    let y = x; // it makes a copy of x, and not a reference of it, it's the same with strings, numbers, and booleans
    console.log(x, y);
    x = 7;
    console.log(x, y);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const players2 = players; // it makes a reference of it, not a copy
    console.log(players, players2);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    players2[1] = 'Thomas'; // altering the reference array alters the original array too
    console.log(players, players2);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // there are several ways of making a copy
    let players3 = players.slice();
    let players4 = Array.from(players);
    let players5 = [...players];
    let players6 = [].concat(players);

    console.log(players3, players4, players5, players6);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    let person2 = Object.assign({}, person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      // if we want several levels deep copy, we need to use a cloneDeep function or JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(source));
    let person3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));

    console.log(person2, person3);
